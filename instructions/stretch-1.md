## Acceptence Criteria

* As an authenticated user, while looking at the list of orders, there should be an affordance (like a button or dropdown) for me to toggle between the open and closed orders. The open orders should show up first.
* As an authenticated user, while looking at the list of orders, I should be able to search the orders by name and/or phone number.
* As an authenticated user, while looking at the revenue view, I should be able to select a start and end date and view the total sum of revenue between those two dates.
* As an authenticated user, while looking at the revenue view, I should be able to see a chart of revenue.
