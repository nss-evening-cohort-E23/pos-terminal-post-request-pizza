# Stretch Goal 3 - Play that Funky Music

## Problem
You are killing the app building game and have really taken over at Hip Hop Pizza and Wangs as an application developer. You and your team are now the go to option for small restaurants around town and the app that you created has drummed up a lot of freelance projects for you.

As a thanks for help getting you started, you offer to support the hip hop cultural aspect of HHP+W by giving them access to booking talent for when the pandemic is over.


## Acceptence Criteria
* Create a feature on the app that will allow for CRUD by Admins for Talent and a list of upcoming shows for anyone visiting the application. These shows can be either in person or virtual.
